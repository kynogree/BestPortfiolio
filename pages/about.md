## About the Kylee

-Kylee Green is an icon and also the moment. A jack of all trades, Kylee has numerous skills ranging from video editing, to sewing, to writing. She once found herself  looking into the black void and has been running ever since. However, when the world feels the sharpest, she knows the void is right behind her. Some of Kyleeâ€™s favorite personal accomplishments include nice pencil sketches of Kermit the frog, a tulle ballroom gown she made for prom, a BHS TV opener costarring her cat, and getting over 5k Tik Tok view on a video about pregnant Joker.  She is the president of Comic Book Book Club at Indiana University and should probably be reading the book for this month right now.
